Write a program that randomly chooses an item from an array of positive integers while the
probability of choosing each item is directly correlated to the number in the array. For example, if
the array is [1,2,3] the probability of choosing 1 is 1/6 the probability of choosing 2 is 1/3 and the
probability of choosing 3 is 0.5. Another example: [1,3,5] means 1/9 for 1, 1/3 for 3 and 5/9 for 5
